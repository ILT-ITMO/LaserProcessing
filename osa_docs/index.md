# LaserProcessing
## Overview
This project focuses on processing data related to laser applications, encompassing data extraction, image segmentation, and physical modeling of laser-induced heat transfer in 3D space. It utilizes SQLite databases for data storage and employs numerical methods, potentially Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), to simulate and analyze laser interactions with materials.

## Purpose
The project aims to provide tools for analyzing microscope images, extracting relevant data, performing segmentation on those images, and simulating the thermal effects of laser radiation within a three-dimensional environment. It appears designed for research or engineering applications involving laser material processing or characterization.
