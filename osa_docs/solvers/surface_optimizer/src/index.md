## Overview
This module provides functionalities for simulating and analyzing physical interactions, particularly those involving elastic bodies and wave propagation. It includes tools for optimization, signal processing, data formatting, and animation generation. The module also contains benchmarking and testing routines for performance evaluation and validation.

## Purpose
This module serves as a core component for modeling physical systems, specifically focusing on contact mechanics and wave phenomena. It enables users to solve contact problems between elastic bodies, analyze frequency spectra, format numerical data for presentation, and visualize simulation results through animations. The included optimization algorithms and testing frameworks support the development and validation of numerical methods for these types of simulations. It is designed for applications requiring accurate modeling of material behavior under external forces or wave excitation.
